    # transact-items : An ordered array of up to 25 TransactGetItem objects, each of which contains a Get structure.
(structure)

Specifies an item to be retrieved as part of the transaction.
Get -> (structure)

Contains the primary key that identifies the item to get, together with the name of the table that contains the item, and optionally the specific attributes of the item to retrieve.
Key -> (map)

A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects that specifies the primary key of the item to retrieve.
key -> (string)
value -> (structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.
Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.
For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .
S -> (string)

An attribute of type String. For example:

"S": "Hello"


N -> (string)

An attribute of type Number. For example:

"N": "123.45"

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.

B -> (blob)

An attribute of type Binary. For example:

"B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"


SS -> (list)

An attribute of type String Set. For example:

"SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

(string)

NS -> (list)

An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

"NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.
(string)

BS -> (list)

An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:

"BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

(blob)

M -> (map)

An attribute of type Map. For example:

"M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

key -> (string)
value -> (structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.
Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

NULL -> (boolean)

An attribute of type Null. For example:
