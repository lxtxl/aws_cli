    # statements : The list of PartiQL statements representing the batch to run.
(structure)

A PartiQL batch statement request.
Statement -> (string)

A valid PartiQL statement.

Parameters -> (list)

The parameters associated with a PartiQL statement in the batch request.
(structure)

Represents the data for an attribute.
Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.
For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .
S -> (string)

An attribute of type String. For example:

"S": "Hello"


N -> (string)

An attribute of type Number. For example:

"N": "123.45"

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.

B -> (blob)

An attribute of type Binary. For example:

"B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"


SS -> (list)

An attribute of type String Set. For example:

"SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

(string)

NS -> (list)

An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

"NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings, to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes for mathematical operations.
(string)

BS -> (list)

An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:

"BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

(blob)

M -> (map)

An attribute of type Map. For example:

"M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

key -> (string)

NULL -> (boolean)

An attribute of type Null. For example:

"NULL": true


BOOL -> (boolean)

An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
