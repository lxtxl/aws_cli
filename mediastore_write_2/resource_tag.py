    # resource : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the container.
    # tags : An array of key:value pairs that you want to add to the container. You need to specify only the tags that you want to add or update. For example, suppose a container already has two tags (customer:CompanyA and priority:High). You want to change the priority tag and also add a third tag (type:Contract). For TagResource, you specify the following tags: priority:Medium, type:Contract. The result is that your container has three tags: customer:CompanyA, priority:Medium, and type:Contract.
(structure)

A collection of tags associated with a container. Each tag consists of a key:value pair, which can be anything you define. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as âenvironmentâ) and the tag value represents a specific value within that category (such as âtest,â âdevelopment,â or âproductionâ). You can add up to 50 tags to each container. For more information about tagging, including naming and usage conventions, see Tagging Resources in MediaStore .
Key -> (string)

Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag key to describe a category of information, such as âcustomer.â Tag keys are case-sensitive.

Value -> (string)

Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a tag value to describe a specific value within a category, such as âcompanyAâ or âcompanyB.â Tag values are case-sensitive.
